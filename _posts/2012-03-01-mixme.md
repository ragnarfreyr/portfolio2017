A [lazycomet](http://www.lazycomet.com) music side project called mixme.fm. Discovering and sharing music that matches your mood has never been easier!

On mixme.fm you request mixtapes based on your mood by naming and tagging your requests accordingly. Other users can then fulfill your request by making you the mixtape of your dreams. Itâ€™s all quite enjoyable. Especially if you like showing off your elite music skills!

The site has now been closed to allow focus on other more valuable Lazycomet projects.
