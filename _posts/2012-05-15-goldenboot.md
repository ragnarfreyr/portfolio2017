[Iceland Review](http://icelandreview.com/) got a few Icelandic designers to work creatively with the traditional Nokia rubber boots.

Over the past few decades, presenting the functionality of a product has become increasingly insignificant while the need for flamboyant and trendy visual style continues to grow. White lies some call it. Others call it advertising. The Golden Boot is a satire resulting from this idealogy. The evident water restistance and flexible functionality of the rubber material is replaced by society's demand for style, glitter, charm and glamour, thus making them appear more desireable.
