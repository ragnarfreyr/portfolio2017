Posters for the [designboom.com Love Your Earth competition](http://www.designboom.com/contest/winner.php?contest_pk=20). The goal was to create a graphic artwork to raise awareness for the environmental problems facing us and our planet.

The posters were shortlisted and chosen to be a part of a poster show at 100% design in Tokyo and Seoul Design Week in 2007.

Done in collaboration with my wife and product designer [Ragnheiður Ösp](http://www.umemi.com).
