We are the Sofa Generation &#8212; the ones who talk about changing things but never actually do anything about it.

Sófakynslóðin (e. The Sofa Generation) is a documentary film about activism in Iceland, produced by [Litli Dímon](http://www.litlidimon.is/).

Illustration done in collaboration with 3D artist Helgi Laxdal.
