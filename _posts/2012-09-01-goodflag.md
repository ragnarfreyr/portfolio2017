Reykjavík Window illustration for GOOD Magazine 019: The Neighborhood Issue. GOOD asked a few designers, artists, and illustrators to create flags celebrating their neighborhoods.

The results were published in the magazine and are now available online at [GOOD's website](http://awesome.good.is/projects/neighborhood-flags/index.html).
