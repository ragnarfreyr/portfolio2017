A poster for Skýjum ofar's (e. Above the Clouds) 15th Anniversary at Barbara in Reykjavík. Skýjum ofar started in 1996 as a weekly radio show, playing drum & bass, breakbeat and electronic music and quickly evolved into regular club nights. The design was based on the very early Skýjum ofar flyers. (See below)
