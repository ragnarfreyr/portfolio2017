_Shake On It_ is a play on the handshake ritual we all know. In some countries people prefer firm handshakes. In others, a weak one.

The handshake is commonly done upon meeting, greeting, parting, offering congratulations, expressing gratitude or completing an agreement. Its purpose is often to convey trust, balance and equality.

The current world record for handshaking is 33 hours and 3 minutes.
