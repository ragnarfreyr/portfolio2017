Vera or Heilsuvera is a web portal where users can communicate with health care providers in Iceland and access documents and personal information from the national health registry such as prescriptions, vaccination history and more.

I worked as a contractor on Vera for TM Software and EMR between June 2013 and October 2014. My work involved concepts, naming, (original) logo design, copywriting, UX wireframes and UI design.

Vera won the best web of 2014 at the Icelandic Web Awards.
